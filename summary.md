# Summary of Actions for Cantire Playwright Framework Setup

## Overview
Created a Cucumber + Playwright framework in JavaScript with separate locator files, Page Object Model, and utility folder.

## Actions Performed

1. **Created Directory Structure**
   - Created main directory: `Cantire Playwright`
   - Created subdirectories:
     - `features/` - For Cucumber feature files
     - `step_definitions/` - For step definition files
     - `pages/` - For Page Object Model classes
     - `locators/` - For locator definitions (CSS selectors)
     - `utils/` - For utility functions and hooks

2. **Created Configuration Files**
   - `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
   - `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration for browsers and settings
   - `cucumber.js` - Cucumber configuration for test execution

3. **Created Utility Files**
   - `utils/hooks.js` - Before/After hooks for browser setup and teardown
   - `utils/generate-report.js` - Script to generate HTML reports from Cucumber results
   - `utils/Utils.js` - General utility functions (e.g., wait, file read/write)

4. **Created Locator File**
   - `locators/locators.js` - Centralized storage for all CSS selectors and locators

5. **Created Page Object Model**
   - `pages/LoginPage.js` - Example page class with methods for login functionality

6. **Created Test Files**
   - `features/login.feature` - Example Cucumber feature file
   - `step_definitions/loginSteps.js` - Step definitions for the login feature

7. **Created Supporting Files**
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for node_modules, logs, reports
   - `README.md` - Documentation for the framework

8. **Installed Dependencies**
   - Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install packages (resolved conflicts with parent Cypress project)
   - Ran `npx playwright install` to install browser binaries

9. **Integrated Allure for Reporting**
   - Added `allure-playwright` to dependencies
   - Updated `playwright.config.js` to use Allure reporter with screenshots on failure
   - Updated `package.json` scripts to generate Allure reports
   - Modified `utils/hooks.js` to configure Allure
   - Added error handling and screenshot attachments in `step_definitions/loginSteps.js`

10. **Fixed Configuration Issues**
    - Corrected `playwright.config.js` which had incorrect JSON content instead of JavaScript
    - Ensured `package.json` has proper JSON format
    - Added timeouts and retries as per best practices

11. **Converted Cypress Commands and Hooks**
    - Converted `commands.js` custom JWT login command to `utils/loginUtils.js` with Playwright equivalents
    - Converted `before_after.js` hooks to Playwright Cucumber hooks in `utils/hooks.js`
    - Implemented utility functions for XLSX reading, file operations, and downloads management
    - Added support for different user roles with tagged hooks (@auditReviewer, @user, etc.)
    - Handled cross-origin Microsoft authentication using Playwright's page context

12. **Environment Variables Integration**
    - Added `dotenv` package for loading environment variables
    - Created `.env` file with example secrets (base URL, usernames, passwords, secrets)
    - Updated all code to use `process.env` for sensitive data
    - Added `.env` to `.gitignore` for security
    - Configured `playwright.config.js` to use `process.env.BASE_URL`
    - Updated hooks and login utilities to load secrets from environment

13. **Fixture Files Migration**
    - Copied all 37 fixture files from Cypress `fixtures/` directory to Playwright `fixtures/` directory
    - Includes Excel files (.xlsx), CSV files, JSON files, text files, ZIP files, and PNG images
    - Files copied: abc.txt, addAndDelRefDoc.xlsx, BulkClaimSheet.zip, claimsheet.xlsx, etc.
    - Maintained original file structure and names for compatibility

14. **Utility Files Conversion**
    - Converted `demo.js`: CSV reading from downloads directory
    - Converted `claimsh.js`: File renaming, zipping, and moving operations
    - Converted `convertzip.js`: Zipping allure-report directory
    - Converted `CSV1.js`: CSV data reading and writing utilities
    - Converted `cucumber-html-report.js`: HTML report generation from JSON logs
    - Converted `Unzipping.js`: File unzipping to downloads directory
    - Converted `SendMail.js`: Email sending with Allure report links (updated for env vars)
    - Converted `removefile.js`: File deletion utilities
    - Converted `readDataFromxlsx.js`: Excel/CSV reading and writing functions
    - Updated paths from `cypress/` to Playwright-compatible paths
    - Added error handling and logging to all utilities
    - Maintained original method names and logic flow

15. **Addrefdoc Feature Conversion**
    - Converted `Addrefdoc.js` page object from Cypress to Playwright
    - Replaced all `cy.` commands with `page.` equivalents
    - Added async/await to all methods
    - Updated file upload handling with `setInputFiles()`
    - Replaced `cy.select()` with `selectOption()`
    - Updated assertions from `cy.should()` to `expect()`
    - Added error handling and screenshot attachments
    - Converted `Addrefdoc.js` step definitions to use `@cucumber/cucumber`
    - Added Allure screenshot attachments on failures
    - Updated environment variable usage from `Cypress.env()` to `process.env`
    - Copied `Addrefdoc.feature` with minor formatting adjustments
    - Added locators to `locators.js` for the Addrefdoc page
    - **Added Missing Methods and Steps:**
      - `nav_manage()`: Navigate to MANAGE page
      - `applyStatusFilter(status)`: Apply status filter
      - `copyFirstClaimNumber()`: Copy first claim number
      - `changeStatusAndSendForApproval()`: Change status and send for approval
      - `verifyFileDownloaded()`: Verify file download
      - Step definitions for all missing scenario steps
    - All scenario steps now have corresponding step definitions
    - All required methods are available in the page object## Framework Structure

## Usage
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Generate reports: `npm run report`
- Base URL in config: Update `playwright.config.js` with actual application URL

## Notes
- Framework uses Playwright for browser automation
- Cucumber for BDD test structure
- Separate concerns: locators, pages, utils
- Configurable for multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- HTML reporting for test results
