To navigate to the comments section, there are several ways to redirect to the comments sections, all of which are listed below:

1) Search for any claim in the Global search, and it will redirect to the claim details window, where the user will find the comment section.

2) In To-dos, navigate to each page, click on the claim, and then access the claim details window, where the user will find the comment section.

3) In the 'Manage Claim' section, there are also claims available. Click on any claim, and you will be redirected to the claim details window, where the user will find the comment section.

Comments are used to provide important details about a claim, which can be visible to both managers and auditor reviewers. There are specific conditions that must be met for a user to view comments related to a specific claim.
Comments come in two types:
Internal Comments
External Comments
1) Internal comments are visible to auditor users and manager users. Within the entire system, there are three types of users:
Auditor role
Manager role  
External Auditor role

2) Comments made internally by auditor users and manager users can be seen by both auditor and manager roles, but external auditor roles cannot view internal comments. If an auditor role or manager role user makes comments externally, those comments become visible to external auditor roles as well, meaning all users can see those comments. Additionally, if an external auditor role user makes comments externally (as they can only make external comments), they can see comments made by auditor and manager role users
When user adds a comment which is externally visible, The message is displayed is the claim History. 

Email Notification is received to the user when a comment (both internal, external) is added to the claim.
